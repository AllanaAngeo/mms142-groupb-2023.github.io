	<h1> What is AVR? </h1>

	<p>Virtual Reality</b> (VR) is a digitally produced, three-dimensional virtual space where users can engage, typically accessed through a computer that can project 3D information on a display. This display may consist of separate screens or a wearable device like a head-mounted display (HMD), complemented by user identification sensors (Jia & Hamad, 2022).
	</p><br>	
	<p>
		<h3> TWO TYPES OF VR </h3>
		<br>
		<p><b> Non-immersive VR </b> employs multiple screens positioned around the user to display virtual information. An illustrative instance of this is observed in driving or flight simulations, where the user, seated in a chair, is surrounded by screens, creating the sensation of being in the cockpit or driverâ€™s seat without complete immersion (Jia & Hamad, 2022).</p>

		<p><b> Immersive VR </b> involves utilizing a wearable display, such as an HMD, to monitor user movements and deliver VR information based on their position. This enables users to encounter the virtual environment from all angles, providing a 360-degree experience (Jia & Hamad, 2022).</p>

		<h3> AVR vs. AR </h3>
		<p><b> Virtual Reality </b> employs a headset to immerse you in a computer-generated environment for exploration. In contrast, augmented reality differs by overlaying digital images onto the real world using a clear visor or smartphone, rather than transporting you to a virtual realm (GCF Global, n.d.).</p>
		<br>
		<p><b> Augmented Reality </b> (AR) is a technology designed to enhance the user's perception by overlaying digital information onto a live view of the real world. Its objective is to broaden the real-world experience by incorporating images, sound, video, and other virtual elements (Cointelegraph, n.d.).</p>
		<br>
		<p><i> The table below is a comparison of Augmented Reality and Advanced Virtual Reality (Cointelegraph, n.d.). </i></p><br>
