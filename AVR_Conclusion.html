	<h1> CONCLUSION </h1>
	<p>Published by: Manuel Aydinan & Anne Penelope Basco | Date: December 15, 2023</p> <br>

	<p>Indeed, AVR has garnered its fair share of critics and advocates, and for good reason—with every step, disruptive technologies continue to 
		redefine the landscape of the human experience. We have established that AVR is a promising tool that can benefit the lifestyle of individuals, the way communities function, 
		how businesses operate, how nations are governed, and generally, the world in terms of international relationships and economies. 
		With tech giants such as Meta and Apple making their pursuit of more ambitious technologies clear to the entire world through their constant innovation 
		and product development, society can only expect to see AVR integrate further into society by being incorporated into various fields and disciplines beyond ICT, 
		be it in communication, education, healthcare, architecture, engineering, businesses, fashion, e-commerce, and leisure or entertainment. 
	</p><br>
	<p> Given this, it is clear that things will inevitably change. The dynamic between consumers, businesses, and their disruptive technologies is fated to shift towards something more stable, 
		and whether that stability comes from its absence or integration will depend on our response to the situation as we come to it. It will soon become a crucial and necessary step to anticipate the changes 
		that AVR will bring and adapt to them before emergent complications force us onto less favorable developments. With the predicted trend in the advancement of technology, striving for a harmonious balance 
		between innovative and ethical advancement will soon become a more important issue than ever before. 
	</p><br>
	<p> The coming era, if current events are any indication, will put to the test our capacity to embrace change—with any luck, 
		we will grow to bear the weight of this responsibility with the grace and compassion our society needs from us. World leaders and policymakers must be prepared 
		to take the necessary steps and invest in essential resources to ensure a seamless transition into a more advanced and fast-paced digital world 
		by partnering with the private sector to deliver exactly what the people need which is accessibility. Knowing that AVR is a progressive instrument 
		that will revolutionize the world as we know it, no sector in society must fall behind. As challenging as this may seem, the process may not be as overwhelming 
		once we acknowledge that AVR’s integration into our lives will happen gradually over the next few years, similar to how the internet, smartphones, 
		and other innovations became a necessity from initially being a luxury. In this slow and steady process, there will be a myriad of new findings and discoveries 
		that will contribute to the ongoing developments that are currently underway concerning AVR, minimizing the possibilities of errors and ensuring a successful transition.
