	<h1> THE CURRENT SITUATION </h1>
	<p>Published by: Hannah Beraquit | Date: December 12, 2023</p> <br>
	<p>
		<p>With the world's technology moving at an unstoppable pace, Augmented Virtual Reality, or AVR, is being used in many industries 
			to improve productivity, entertainment, and education. Many nations have made investments in this technology because they think
			 it will encourage national innovation and development.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of the uses of VR across the world are just the following:
		</p><br>

		<h3> 1. Digital Prototyping</h3><br>
			<p>An advantageous application of VR is the creation of 3D models in a virtual environment, providing a concrete
				visualization. Prototypes or initial designs of products can be modeled and presented within a virtual space, facilitating testing and evaluation processes (Jia & Hamad, 2022). 
			</p><br>

			<p>One of the industries benefitting from this is the automotive insudtry, stiving from traditional clay models (Thompson, 2022).Automakers 
				such as Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover have utilized Virtual Reality to explore the appearance and construction of vehicles before 
				creating physical prototypes. This alllows automakers to design and review engineering models in-depth.
			</p><br>
		<h3> 2. Digital Simulation</h3><br>
			<p>The US military enhanced its training program by utilizing AVR, which boosts battlefield preparedness. Immersion rooms, head-mounted 
				displays (HMDs) with motion trackers, full-body tracking systems, and wireless weapon controllers are used to mimic actual military weaponry 
				are all used in some military bases. This allows soldiers to collaborate better and take accountability of actions in battle.

			<p><br>
				Furthermore,  China continues to keep up with technological advancements. In 2022, the Chinese government designed the most comprehensive set of policies for the development of the metaverse known as the "Virtual Reality and Industry Application 
				Integration Development Action Plan (2022-2026)."Through technological innovation, the action plan seeks to significantly transform human production and lifestyles. It does this by developing
				VR machines, perceived interaction, content collection, and production equipment, as well as by generating 3D graphics, dynamic modeling, real-time motion capture, and high-speed rendering. 
			</p><br>
		<h3> 3. Health care </h3><br>
			<p>Virtual Reality is utilized by medical institutions to enhance the familiarity and proficiency of health professionals. 
					Osso VR, a surgical training and assessment platform, provides spaces for surgeons to immerse themselves in a virtual 
					operating room, enabling them to engage with various medical devices and practice surgical procedures on simulated bodies 
					(Thompson, 2022). 
			</p><br>

			<p>	VR was also employed in the US in during the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual reality technology was utilized for training simulations 
				in order to create and distribute safety protocols as well as for online medical consultations, which were necessary for stopping the virus from spreading. 
				Moreover, it is employed in other advanced medical innovations and processes like precise symptom diagnosis and immersive training in medicine.</p><br>

		<h3>4. Retail and Fashion</h3><br>
			<p> VR Studio Emperia, a Virtual Reality platform for retail and fashion, has partnered with renowned clothing brands such as 
				Ralph Lauren and Gucci to create customized virtual environments. Digital renditions of their physical stores provide customers 
				with the chance to explore the brand's collections and clothing options, eliminating the costs associated with travel and saving 
				time (Thompson, 2022).

 		<h3>5. Interior Design</h3><br>
			<p>Immersive experiences can now replicate interior design as well. Companies like Flipspaces are taking advantage of this trend 
					by offering users 3D visualizations of their home or workspace interiors. This includes aspects such as lighting, ventilation, 
					color schemes, and even the visualization of various products (Thompson, 2022).
			</p><br>

		<h3>6. Meetings and Conferences</h3><br>
			<p> As virtual reality allows people to gather in virtual spaces, it is not a surprise that the pandemic led to an increase in VR 
					events, conferences, and meetings. Platforms like Glue, Arthur, and Meeting Room facilitate collaborative and interactive meetings, 
					allowing colleagues to connect from any location worldwide (Thompson, 2022).

	<h1> The Local Landscape </h1><br>
	<p>
		In the Philippines, however, the realm of AR and VR applications is still in its early stages, with only limited implementation. 
		Although AVR adoption and utilization have been slower, we can see some of its applications in healthcare, education, the military, and 
		gaming. Despite the spread of the virus, it paved the way for students to continue their education, particularly during the pandemic. 
		Students were able to access education through the use of online learning applications and materials with the assistance of AR applications, 
		which provide students with an interactive and engaging learning environment.
	</p><br>
	<p>
		Taking all of this into account, it appears that the use of AVR is still not fully leveraged in the Philippines, which could be due to 
		limited technological infrastructure, economic factors, a lack of awareness and understanding about the technology, digital literacy, cultural 
		factors, or market demand and business opportunities. Unfortunately, the country's slower adoption and utilization of AVR speaks volumes about 
		its ability to develop and advance technologically and economically. Embracing and leveraging AVR technologies in the Philippines has the 
		potential to drive positive change in a variety of areas, including economic growth, innovation, education, healthcare, and overall societal 
		well-being. It has the potential to establish the Philippines as a technologically advanced and competitive player on the global stage.
