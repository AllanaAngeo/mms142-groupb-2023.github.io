	<h1> THE CURRENT SITUATION </h1>

	<p>With the world's technology moving at an unstoppable pace, Augmented Virtual Reality, or AVR, is being used in many industries to improve productivity, entertainment, and 
		education. Many nations have made investments in this technology because they think it will encourage national innovation and development.
	</p>	
	<p>
		For example, it was employed in the US in search of solutions to issues that arose during the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual reality technology was utilized for training simulations 
		in order to create and distribute safety protocols as well as for online medical consultations, which were necessary for stopping the virus from spreading. Moreover, it is employed
		in other advanced medical innovations and processes like precise symptom diagnosis and immersive training in medicine. Additionally, the US military enhanced its training program by
		utilizing AVR, which boosts battlefield preparedness and confidence. Immersion rooms, head-mounted displays (HMDs) with motion trackers, full-body tracking systems, and wireless weapon 
		controllers that mimic actual military weaponry are all used in some military bases in the state. This makes it easier for soldiers to learn how to collaborate and how their actions can
		 affect their comrades in combat.
