		Virtual Reality is currently gaining popularity and interest in different industries and sectors right before our very eyes. 
		Since this is continuously evolving, it is predicted that AR and VR will soon be at the center of digital transformation where the investments and spending of companies and consumers may increase by 80% over the next few years. 
		Moreover, Canorea (2022) unfolds some of the further developments that AVR can cater to us with the further investments in this technology coming into place:

			<dt> <h3> LiDAR and AVR </h3> </dt>
			<dd> 
				LiDar, also known as Light Detection and Ranging, is a remote sensing technology that utilizes laser light to acquire measurements and create 3D models of the environment. 
				Although LiDAR has long been introduced, integrating and focusing more of this technology into AVR can even add endless possibilities in the virtual world.
			</dd>
			<br>
			<dt> <h3> AVR at One’s fingertips </h3> </dt>
			<dd> 
				Since VR equipment, such as headsets, is quite inconvenient for everyday use, the future of virtual reality will implement its technology in mobile devices to make things more lightweight and compact. 
				This will make it easier for users to take full advantage of VR and reach its full potential at the ease of our fingertips—anywhere and everywhere we go.
			</dd>
			<br>
			<dt> <h3> AVR to be more friendly in our pockets </h3> </dt>
			<dd>
				Currently, VR headsets have high price points, making them not easily accessible and affordable to general consumers. 
				Fortunately, VR technologies will become more cost-efficient with continued investment in them where general consumers will have the chance to get in touch with virtual reality at a friendlier price.
			</dd>
			<br>
			<dt> <h3> More powerful AVR </h3> </dt>
			<dd> 
				Last but not least, with continuous funding for this technology, new VR equipment can also be introduced to the market such as robots and other futuristic models we have yet to see. 
				This will also step up our future in helping more sectors that seek its help. Additionally, immersive sports and events can also arise in the field of VR once it has been set forth for public consumption. 
			</dd>
			<br>
			<p>
				With all these being said, AVR is a great step in technology especially the advantages it can give to mankind. 
				Most studies show that the potential of this technology can be seen as early as 5 to 10 years wherein its benefits, 
				and even challenges, can affect different facets of our lives (Future of Virtual Reality - Market Trends and Challenges, 2023). 
				Sooner or later, VR is about to take in the full spectrum where we should brace ourselves for a newer shift in our way of living.
