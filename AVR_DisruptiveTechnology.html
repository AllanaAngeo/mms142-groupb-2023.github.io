    <p class="TitleTextDT">Written by: Hannah Beraquit | Published: December 15, 2023</p>
    <p class="TitleTextDT">In our contemporary era, human ingenuity persists in pushing the boundaries of technology, striving for optimal efficiency, and achieving feats once deemed impossible.For every problem, a technological solution is offered, causing the development of innovations that significantly alter or revolutionize an existing industry or field. These newly developed technologies then alter how we humans perform tasks. Such groundbreaking technology is characterized as disruptive, reshaping the landscape of our capabilities and possibilities.</p>
 </div>

<div class="divDefineDT">

<h3 class="subheadings">Defining Disruptive Technologies</h3>
<p class="DefineDTText"> The word “disruptive technology was first coined by Clayton Christensen in a Harvard Business Review article titled “Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave” in 1995. Since then, this concept has gained significant traction, becoming a buzzword in startup circles aiming to develop products with widespread appeal. 
<br>
<br>
To put into context, these technologies are referred to as ‘disruptive’ as they alter human perspective (Indeed, 2023). Smith (2022) defines ‘disruptive technology’ as technological innovations that replace existing behavior by incorporating refined technological inventions into daily activities. These are innovations that have made an impact on society and are generally accessible to the masses. It can also be referred to as mainstream innovation that has changed the way most people think or behave about a certain task or subject.</p>

    <div class="divExDT">
    <h3 class="subheadings">Examples of Disruptive Technologies</h3>
<p class="ExDTText"> Disruptive technologies have entered numerous industries and have changed our landscape drastically. Some examples of emerging technologies can include the following (Simplilearn, 2023):</p>
<ul class="ExDTText">
	<li><b>Smartphones:</b> Smartphones have disrupted traditional mobile phone industries by combining communication, computing, and various other functions in a single device.</li>
	<li><b>Blockchain Technology:</b> Blockchain has changed traditional financial systems by introducing decentralized and secure transaction methods, as seen in cryptocurrencies.</li>
	<li><b>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</b> AI technologies, including machine learning and natural language processing, are entering different industries from healthcare and finance to customer service and manufacturing.</li>
	<li><b>E-commerce: </b>Companies like Amazon have altered traditional retail by providing an online marketplace, changing the way people shop, and impacting brick-and-mortar stores.</li>
	<li><b>AR/VR Technology: </b>Collectively known as extended reality (XR), these technologies offer substantial benefits in healthcare, allowing for medical diagnoses and examinations, and in education, particularly in overcoming challenges such as overcrowded classrooms or remote learning during a global pandemic.
</li>
</ul>

	<div class="divImpactDT">
<h3 class="subheadings">Impact of Disruptive Technology</h3>
<p>McKinney (2022) states the impact of technology wherein disruptive innovation contributes to societal improvement by developing efficiency, productivity, and convenience. A great example of this is the existence of the internet which has made information more accessible and communication more efficient. This has resulted in lower research time and more timely conversations. 
<br>
<br>
However, this impact on technology may also be perceived negatively during its early stages of development in society. Due to sudden changes in human behavior, Disruptions may affect specific individuals and industries that are unable to adapt to emerging technologies. While disruptive technologies offer improved solutions to challenges that the existing system could not address, potentially revolutionizing society with increased efficiency, productivity, and convenience, they can also pose challenges for individuals and businesses unable to adapt.
<br>
<br>
With the potential of disruptive technologies, governments are encouraged to create a supportive environment for emerging innovations. This means giving businesses the opportunity to adapt to new technologies and investing in research to encourage new ideas. Governments can also encourage people and businesses to use these new technologies by supporting them in different ways.

<p>In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, organizations are undergoing transformations by integrating artificial intelligence, cloud computing, data analytics, and other emerging technologies into their operations.</p>

<div class="LandSCDTLeft2">
  <p> The 2016 KPMG Technology Innovation & Business Transformation Survey revealed that 93% of companies were only at the initial stages of adopting new business models. recent findings from the 2018 KPMG Technology Innovation report identify Google, Apple, and Microsoft as the top three leaders in reshaping technological innovations. This assessment, based on input from technology innovation leaders, startup entrepreneurs, and Fortune 500 executives representing the C-suite, shows substantial progress in technological adaptation since 2016 (ECCP, 2019). <br>

    <p>In the case of the Philippines, the government has been eyeing the use of disruptive technologies, most especially in the field of agriculture in Asia-Pacific. Agriculture Secretary William Dar emphasized the use of innovations like e-commerce and GPS to bring farming practices into the 21st century during the 36th session of the Asia Pacific Regional Conference of the FAO in Dhaka, Bangladesh. These disruptive technologies aim to replace old systems, providing cost-efficient and superior attributes for farmers, fishers, consumers, and businesses (Department of Agriculture, 2022).</p> <br>
    <br>
    <p>Furthermore, PLDT and Smart Lead are currently working on the development of the Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN). This type of technology would essentially benefit telcos save on cost and allow flexibility in making networks through developing hardware and software  from any vendor using open-source software and general-purpose hardware. This would  allow different components of the radio network to be disaggregated to create a  more intelligent and efficient system. </p>

<ul id="statul">
	<li>In 2021, 47.5 percent of respondents identified AI/Machine Learning as the most impactful disruptive technology, marking a decline from previous years.  This decrease may be attributed to the perception that artificial intelligence is becoming less disruptive, given its widespread implementation and common usage (Statista Research Department, 2023).</li>
	<li>The market for augmented reality is expected to grow nearly 40% in the next seven years due to enhanced data visualization and analytics.</li>
	<li>Nearly 90% of businesses have integrated blockchain technology while 87% plan to invest more in the next year (CoreSite, n.d).</li>
